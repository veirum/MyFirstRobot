# My First Robot
There are many popular robots and robot kits out there designed to introduce and teach people how to program. However, they often involve the task of building a robot before you get to the actual programming. My First Robot is a project that tries to omit this, for many, daunting layer, by offering a virtual robot that you can program right at the get go. Another advantage is that it is a lot cheaper than buying full class sets of Lego Mindstorm that is often to expensive.

Ready... set... code!
